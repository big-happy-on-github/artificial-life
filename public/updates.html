              <p>I am aware that in the last week, there was a bug that was stopping users from playing LiamsTD aswell as sending feedback. I have fixed that, and added kabir and shuka as towers. I would like to let y'all know that sometime soon, I will probably send my site for review for Google AdSense. To fit their criteria, I will not update the site as drastically as in the early stages, and will probably just add new games or do minor fixes. Of course, if need be, major changes might happen. Shut downs might also occur if I feel that a bug is so drastic the game is unplayable.</p>

              <p>In the last couple days, I have added Liam's Chat. I don't really feel like explaining everything, so just check it out for yourself.</p>

              <h2>10/12/2024 - first update</h2>
              <p>This is the first update to be showcased in the update page. In the last few days, I have added 2 new towers to LiamsTD. Ciaran, a meat shield, and david, who constantly shoots in 4 directions. I also made bullets from far range towers shoot faster to reduce the chance of missing when shooting, although it can still happen, and added waves up to 60. Overall, I kind of just fixed bugs and everything, pretty chill. I did add a admin command menu though. Bet you can't get to it ;).</p>
